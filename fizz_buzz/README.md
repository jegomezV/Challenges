# Fizz Buzz in Python

Welcome to my Fizz Buzz project in Python! My name is Juan Eduardo Gomez, and I'm excited to share this project with you. Here you'll find a simple and elegant implementation of the famous Fizz Buzz game in Python.

## What is Fizz Buzz?

Fizz Buzz is a commonly used game/exercise to teach programming to beginners. The objective is to print a sequence of numbers, but with a twist: instead of saying the number itself, you should say "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5. Otherwise, simply print the number itself.
